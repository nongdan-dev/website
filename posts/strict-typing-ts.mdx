Strict typing in TypeScript is a core concept that ensures variables, functions, parameters, and
function return values adhere to a specific data type. This helps detect errors at compile-time
rather than runtime, increasing code safety and quality.

### Concept and Benefits of Strict Typing

When we enable strict mode in TypeScript (by setting "strict": true in the tsconfig.json file),
TypeScript activates a series of strict type checking options such as:

- **noImplicitAny**: Flags errors when a variable or parameter does not have a clearly defined type
  and is therefore implicitly assigned the any type. This helps prevent variables from
  unintentionally becoming any, losing the benefits of static type checking.
- **strictNullChecks**: Flags errors when using variables expected to have values without checking
  for null or undefined, unless we explicitly declare and initialize them. This ensures that errors
  due to null value handling are detected early.
- **strictFunctionTypes**: Applies strict type checking to function parameters, ensuring that
  functions do not distort the defined data types when passing arguments.
- **strictBindCallApply**: Strictly checks the use of function methods bind, call, and apply,
  ensuring that the types of passed arguments match the defined types.
- **strictPropertyInitialization**: Requires all class properties to be initialized (or marked as
  possibly undefined) in the constructor or through direct initialization.
- **noImplicitThis**: Ensures that the this keyword in functions is always assigned a specific data
  type instead of the any type.
- **alwaysStrict**: Forces the compiler to convert TypeScript code to JavaScript in JavaScript's
  "strict mode", enhancing security and minimizing unexpected errors.

Applying strict typing offers many benefits:

- **Early Error Detection**: When code is strictly type-checked, errors due to incorrect type
  assignments or incorrect data operations are reported during compilation.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Code with clear types helps developers easily understand the data
  flow and program behavior, reducing risks when modifying or extending code.
- **IDE and Tooling Support**: Editors like Visual Studio Code provide better auto-completion, error
  checking, and code refactoring when the data types of variables and functions are clear.
- **Reduced Runtime Errors**: Thanks to static type checking, most errors related to incorrect data
  type usage are detected before the code runs, avoiding application crashes or freezes.

### How to Enable Strict Typing in TypeScript

To enable strict typing, modify the tsconfig.json file as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
    // ...other options
  }
}
```

With "strict": true, all the above options are enabled, making data type checking more rigorous.

### Illustrative Examples

Example of noImplicitAny mode:

```jsx
// Error: Parameter 'name' implicitly has an 'any' type.
function greet(name) {
  console.log(Hello, ${name}!);
}

// Corrected:
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log(Hello, ${name}!);
}
```

Here, to avoid errors, we need to declare the data type for the name variable.

Example of strictNullChecks mode:

```jsx
function processString(str: string | null) {
  // Error: Object is possibly 'null'.
  console.log(str.length);
}

// Corrected:
function processString(str: string | null) {
  if (str) {
    console.log(str.length);
  }
}
```

Without checking, calling str.length when str is null will cause an error.

Example of strictFunctionTypes mode:

```jsx
// Strict type checking for function parameters.
let func1: (x: string) => void = (y: any) => {}; // Error
let func2: (x: any) => void = (y: string) => {}; // OK
```

Example of strictBindCallApply mode:

```jsx
function greet(this: { name: string }, message: string) {
  console.log(${this.name}: ${message});
}

const user = { name: "Alice" };

greet.call(user, "Hello"); // OK
greet.call({}, "Hello"); // Error
```

Here, stricter checks are applied when using .bind(), .call(), and .apply().

Example of noImplicitThis mode:

```jsx
function example() {
  // Error: 'this' implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation.
  console.log(this.value);
}

// Corrected:
function example(this: { value: number }) {
  console.log(this.value);
}
```

Example of alwaysStrict mode:

```jsx
// TypeScript compiler will output JavaScript in strict mode.
function example() {
  'use strict'
  // ...
}
```

### Conclusion

Strict typing in TypeScript is a powerful mechanism to ensure data type safety, detect errors early,
and enhance code maintainability. By enabling strict mode in tsconfig.json, developers can force
TypeScript's static type checking system to ensure that all variables, functions, and objects have
defined data types, avoiding errors due to incorrect type usage. This not only improves code quality
but also enhances the development experience with better support from tools and IDEs.

With strict typing, TypeScript projects become safer, more maintainable, and less prone to runtime
errors. This is why many large projects now adopt strict mode to ensure system consistency and
reliability.

### Further Enhancements

In addition to TypeScript's strict modes, typescript-eslint provides a range of rules to enforce
best practices in data type usage and control type coverage in projects. This helps to check source
code more rigorously, avoiding potential errors when using non-specific data types or unsafe type
conversions.

One of the important rules provided by typescript-eslint is the @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
rule. This rule prohibits the explicit use of the any type in source code, forcing specific data
type declarations or the use of generics if needed.

```jsx
funtion processData(data:any) {
  // handle data
}

funtion processData(data:1) {
  // Safe data type handling
}
```

Besides prohibiting the use of any, typescript-eslint can also set rules to limit or prohibit type
conversions using the as syntax. Rules like @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-assertions are
configured to ensure that type conversions are performed only in safe and necessary cases.

```jsx
//If the rule prohibits type conversion using 'as'
const element = document.querySelector('#my-element') as HTMLDivElement;

// Instead, perform a safe type check:
const element = document.querySelector('#my-element');
if (element && element instanceof HTMLDivElement) {
  // Now you have confirmed that the element is of type HTMLDivElement
}
```
