Data is at the core of most web and mobile applications. From **news feeds** on social media to **product catalogs** on e-commerce platforms and **data analytics dashboards**, much of the UI revolves around displaying lists of data.

It's safe to say that **90% of web development work involves displaying and managing these lists**. However, as data grows, rendering thousands of items at once can **reduce performance**, leading to **slow experiences**. This is where **Infinite Scroll and Virtual List** come into play.

## Infinite Scroll

What happens when users want to view a massive dataset? Clearly, you can't throw them a list containing **millions of records**. But why?

### The Problem with Loading All Data at Once

- **Browser Overload**: Displaying thousands or millions of items in the DOM leads to:
  - High **RAM usage**
  - The browser constantly **repainting** and **reflowing** the DOM
  - **Laggy and slow** experiences
- **Network Performance Issues**:
  - Sending an API request to fetch **millions of records at once** will:
    - **Take a long time to load**
    - **Consume significant bandwidth**
    - **Risk timeout errors**
- Most users **don’t scroll through all the data**, so loading everything upfront is **unnecessary**.

### What About Pagination?

- **Pagination** requires users to click a `Next` button to load more content.
- This works well for **data tables**, but it **disrupts the flow of browsing**.
- For apps like **TikTok, Facebook, and Shopee**, **natural scrolling** is more important than repeatedly clicking `Next`.
  **Infinite Scroll solves this by:**

- **Automatically loading new data as users scroll.**
- **Maintaining a seamless browsing experience.**
- **Being ideal for social media feeds, product catalogs, and news pages.**

## How Infinite Scroll Works

[See the illustration here](https://www.tldraw.com/f/l42oxUgeWzUiYcaaVhvPh?d=v-1048.-353.3194.1734.EEUukuWMI7b6HJHHgiu8Q)

## Virtual Scroll (Virtual List)

### The Problem with Infinite Scroll

Infinite Scroll **loads data in chunks**, but it still has a **major drawback**:

1. **DOM Overload Over Time**
   - As the list expands, the number of DOM elements increases.
   - The browser **consumes more RAM**, causing **lag**.
2. **Expensive Reflow & Repaint**
   - Every scroll triggers **layout recalculations**.
   - The more elements on the page, the **slower** the performance.
3. **Unnecessary Resource Consumption**
   - Even if elements are hidden, they still consume **memory**.

**Virtual Scroll solves this by only rendering what's visible on the screen.**
As you scroll, it **dynamically adds/removes** elements from the DOM.

### How Does Virtual Scroll Work?

Virtual Scroll works by **only rendering the visible items** in the viewport and a small buffer above/below. As you scroll, it **recycles DOM elements** to display new content.

### Why Not Just Hide Elements with CSS?

You might think that **hiding elements** (`display: none`) or using `content-visibility: hidden` is enough. However, this **DOES NOT reduce resource usage** because:

### Key Benefits of Virtual Scroll

- **Improved Performance**: Only renders what's visible
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Unused elements are removed from the DOM
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Even with large datasets

## Edge Cases When Implementing

### Dynamic Height Items

- When the list contains items with varying heights, calculating scroll positions becomes complex.
- Use an **Item Size Estimator** or **Position Indexing**.

### Fast Scrolling to a Specific Item

When jumping to a specific item (e.g., `Scroll to product #500`), you need to:

- Determine the exact position of the item
- Calculate the **correct offset**

### Horizontal Scrolling (Horizontal Virtual Scroll)

### Horizontal Scrolling (Horizontal Virtual Scroll)

Useful for **horizontally scrollable lists**, such as:

- Video lists (YouTube, Netflix)
- Large data tables

Optimize using **CSS Grid or Flexbox**.

### Conclusion

## Conclusion

Both **Infinite Scroll** and **Virtual List** are **powerful tools** for optimizing performance when displaying large datasets.

### When to Use Each

**Use Infinite Scroll when:**

- You want to **load content continuously** without pagination
- **Natural scrolling** is important
- The list is **not extremely long** (e.g., under 1,000 items)

**Use Virtual Scroll when:**

- The list is **very long** (thousands of items)
- You need to **reduce the number of DOM elements** to avoid lag
- Performance optimization is critical for your use case
